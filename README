## What is Typewriter?

We made Typewriter for our clients – summer camps – based on a decade of experience making changes, swapping photos, and posting updates. Everyone wants to have the ability to post news and make routine changes to their website. This is the 90% that Typewriter gives you easy access to. Typewriter is designed to encourage good habits – like checking your statistics and posting to your various social networks.
